<!-- The Method Attribute-->
<!-- -->
<!-- The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.-->
<!-- The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").-->
<!-- The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. -->

<!-- This example uses the GET method when submitting the form data:-->
<!-- -->
<!-- Notes on GET:

Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google-->

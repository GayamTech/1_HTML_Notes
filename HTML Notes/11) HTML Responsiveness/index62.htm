<!-- A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.-->


<!-- Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones) -->



<!-- To create a responsive website, add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages:-->









<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
<body>

<h2>Setting the Viewport</h2>
<p>This example does not really do anything, other than showing you how to add the viewport meta element.</p>

</body>
</html>
